#Practical Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms in R and Python 

Here I attempted to implement basic Machine algorithms in both R and Python

The datasets used are 

US Airlines Delay - <http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html>


##Logistic Regression

Here I attempted to predict  Departure delays for flights originating from JFK Airport using 2007 data.


*TODO : Python Implementation*
