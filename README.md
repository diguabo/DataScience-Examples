#Practical Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms in R and Python 

Implementation of basic Machine algorithms in both R and Python

The dataset(s) used for this are as below 

US Airlines Datasets - <http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html>

###Logistic Regression

Attempt to predict  Departure delays for flights originating from JFK Airport using 2007 data.

Note: Filtered out Cancelled flights but retained diverted flights

####Key Features used for prediction:  

* Month of Year
*  Hour of Departure
*  Carrier 
*  Destination
*  Distance (as a quantile range)
