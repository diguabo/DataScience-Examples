I have not checked in dll's and python moduels for dlib since C++ executables are compiler specific and version specific.

You need to complie dlib and its parent lib boost from its source code as explained here
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/building.html
http://dlib.net/compile.html

Also the imglab.exe need to be compiled from source if you need to edit the objectboundaries.xml from images\train folder.
